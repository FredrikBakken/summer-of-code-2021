participants of the Unikraft Summer of Code 2021 (USoC21).  If you are not
participating in USoC21 feel free to use this site and its resources to learn
how to build Unikraft unikernels.*

Unikraft Summer of Code is a **free** two week virtual Unikernel and library
Operating Systems workshop held by members of the Unikraft community including
professors, lecturers and PhD students from:

 * [University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest](http://nets.cs.pub.ro),
 * [Lancaster University](https://net.scc.lancs.ac.uk),
 * [Manchester University](https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/advanced-processor-technologies/), and
 * industry partners [NEC Laboratories Europe GmbH](http://sysml.neclab.eu).

To learn more about Unikraft, please visit the [Unikraft Project
Website](https://unikraft.org), visit the [main documentation website](http://docs.unikraft.org) or checkout the [GitHub project](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft).

In this workshop, you will learn about how to build Unikraft unikernels,
including zero-to-hero workshops on how to get started using Unikraft. As the
week progresses, we will dive into more in-depth topics of Unikraft, including
programming structures and architectures, how it is organized, methodologies for
porting libraries and applications to Unikraft and more!

The workshop will be hands-on and will take place for 10 days, between August 23
and September 3, 2021, 4pm-8pm CEST. And an 8 hours hackathon on September 4,
2021, 9am-5pm CEST. It will be online and in English. Topics include building
unikernels, benchmarking, debugging, porting applications, virtualization and
platform specifics.

If you're up to the challenge and want to expand your knowledge in Operating
Systems and unikernels and engage in the Unikraft community, then [apply to the
workshop by filling in this form](https://bit.ly/USoC21ApplicationForm).  As spaces to the
workshop are limited, all applications require a short motivation on willingess
to participate.  Generally, however, all spaces to the workshop are based on
